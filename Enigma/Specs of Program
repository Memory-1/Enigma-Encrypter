Some key aspects of this program

* It will sanitize all input to lowercase.
* If there are non [a-z] characters, it will return the character and increase the shift
This is important that the shift increases, so if it is not the same message, it will not get the same output
* There is a check to see if any of the wheel settings are invalid
